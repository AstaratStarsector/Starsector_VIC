vic,FACTION,"Volkov Industrial Conglomerate (VIC), also referred to as simply The Conglomerate, is an ambitious and rather aggressive corporate state which ardently promotes the ideas of transhumanism and specializes in heavy industry and bio-genetic technologies, selling its products to all who desire to break free of their natural limits. Having an extremely controversial history and grim reputation and assumed to be destroyed in the wake of the Collapse, VIC suddenly returned to the Sector in c+202 from the previously inaccessible Empyrean star system, which was thought to be irrevertibly lost after its Jump Points violently imploded just a couple of years after the Collapse. Living up to their old ruthless public image, VIC swiftly conquered a small independent colony in their vicinity and informed rest of the Sector of their resurgence. With a society changed beyond recognition, fully adopting genetech which in some cases leaves little to none of what could be seen as ""human"", VIC are now dead set on spreading their influence by all means to ensure humanity's survival and evolution through genetic modification amidst the ongoing crisis. Even if it requires to reject all that could be considered ""humane"".


Detailed information excerpted from an essay of a renowned Chicomoztoc's historian Joselyn Frye on VIC's origins, banned from further publishing by COMSEC with unusual haste:
According to the surviving data, the history of VIC goes back to as far as about 400 years. Founded long before the Collapse by business partners and longtime friends Victor Volkov and Marcus Tellen, the company was initially called “Frontier Dynamics” and focused on supporting colonization effort of the Domain. An important turning point in the history of the growing business was the acquisition of Atagara MedTech, at that time actively engaged in genetic research and human life extension projects. A few months after the merger, Marcus Tellen suddenly left the company on what was reportedly an “ideological disagreement” with the CEO V. Volkov.

Merging and acquiring more and more firms under its wing and renamed to VIC, the corporation soon started working even more closely with the Domain’s higher echelons, receiving hefty financial infusions and juridical privileges in return for merciless suppression of numerous rebellions and providing other services, including medical ones, details of which are still unknown up to this day. During that period, after accusing VIC of mass kidnappings and conduction of illegal human experiments in various fringe sectors, Marcus Tellen was found dead in his own house. According to official statements, the cause of death was suicide, and the investigations against VIC were hastily terminated by the Domain’s officials the next month.

Thanks to the Collapse and prolonged isolation in their headquarter star system due to the so called “Jump Point Accident”, the Conglomerate has surely gone through some radical changes. Nowadays, led by an enigmatic entity referred to as “The Lightbringer”, VIC attempt to both cooperate with similar-sized organizations and stay out of conflicts with the bigger powers of the Sector with the help of bribery and scheming, while at the same time having a disturbing tendency to predate on weaker colonies and factions alike, merging them into the corporate system. Going as far as working with outlaws, criminals and pirates, VIC grow in power with every passing day and do not shun backstabbing their temporary allies as soon as the balance of power turns in the megacorp's favour. Despite their sugar-coated PR statements and attempts to appease potential sources of threat, one thing still stays certain nonetheless – VIC won't allow anyone to stand in what they consider the only true way to the survival of mankind.

#Ships,,,,,
vic_apollyon,SHIP,"VIC-A71 ""Apollyon"" - ""The Destroyer"", a shining symbol of VIC's heavy industry, an unusually mobile capital ship for its significant size, equipped with just enough weaponry to obliterate entire enemy fleets on its own. However, due to the design being focused on raw offense and speed, Apollyon lacks capital-grade armour and is incapable of withstanding focused enemy attacks even with the help of a powerful shield generator.

Conceived out of spite towards Tri-Tachyon and with a goal to overthrow the Paragon's reign in the Domain's Navy, the Apollyon project ended up being one of the most ambitious and expensive endeavours of the Conglomerate, with the developement costs nearing the price of a couple of outback planets combined. Unsurprisingly, most of the time and budget were spent on calculating how to apply jet-fighter principles to the hull of such size.

Unfortunately for VIC and despite all their efforts, the project still didn't manage to make its way into the Navy. The main reason for that - the Collapse happening right in the middle of Apollyon's first official presentation, mere seconds after the prototype turned a Paragon test target into a melted metallic mess to thunderous applause of the Admiralty's officials. 

To the great delight of the surviving Central Design Bureau, the project wasn't scrapped after the Collapse and eventually entered mass production to serve both as VIC's most potent assault vessel and as one of its main propaganda tools. Nowadays the imposing Apollyon-class shturmcapitals proudly roam the Sector at the head of the Conglomerate's fleets, both playing the role of a compelling argument during numerous diplomatic negotiations and truly living up to their old biblical name in battles. ",,,
vic_nybbas,SHIP,"VIC-X04 ""Nybbas"" - ""The manager of dreams and visions"", also dubbed ""The Weaver of Nightmares"" by both its pilots and those who face it in battle. Going beyond all reasonable, this unusual phase hyperfrigate at its core is nothing more but a giant chain of energy systems powering its weaponry, phase coils and teleportation drive. 

Created a couple of years prior to the Collapse as the ultimate ""hunter-assasin"" vessel, the Nybbas project is a great example of why the design bureau should never be given too much budget and freedom in decision-making.

Attempts to fit so much into the smallest possible hull led to the fact that Nybbas is almost completely devoid of any armor and even crew accomodation. And huge amplitudes of energy surges during flight and active fighting make this ship absolutely unsuitable, dangerous and sometimes even fatal for long-term piloting.

All crews who were unlucky enough to be assigned to Nybbas frigates are advised to take significant doses of painkillers and should immediately report any psychological or physiological abnormalities after prolonged combat operations.",,,
vic_pruflas,SHIP,"VIC-S75 ""Pruflas"" - ""Provoker of wars and discord"", a reconaissance frigate of novel design with paper-thin armour but unmatched mobility and decent firepower. 

Entering the service not until after the Collapse, Pruflas frigates are the fastest vessels at the megacorp's disposal. Their spectacular speed and impressive fuel-to-distance ratio secured their role not only of the main scouting unit, but also of a courier, capable of quickly delivering valuable information and the so-called ""special gifts"" to the Hegemony's officials, pirate warlords and leaders/higher-ups of many other factions. In many cases such generous ""signs of goodwill"" still do not ensure proper cooperation between the addressees and the Conglomerate, but usually it's just enough to prevent full-fledged military confrontation, even if hatred and disgust towards the megacorp remain in their fullest.

#Ship Systems,,,,,
vic_quantumlunge,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Propels ship forward, ignoring collission with ships, projectiles and other obstacles. After movement is finished, releases a beam behind the ship, dealing damage to all non-allied entities. Lunge reignites the engines and can be canceled at any time.",,,
vic_adaptiveassault,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Temporarily increases ballistic weapons' rate of fire and decreases their flux generation, and also increases energy weapons' damage. The bonus strength depends on the loadout of the ship.",,,
vic_emergencyDefense,SHIP_SYSTEM,Temporarily forces all fighters to Regroup mode and substantially increases their stats. ,,,
vic_DriftBoost,SHIP_SYSTEM,Allows the ship to make a rapid dash into any desired direction.,,,

#Weapons,,,,,
vic_rubicon,WEAPON,"The Rubicon's projectile exists in a state of quantum uncertainty, occupying many possible locations at any given time. When the projectile impacts against a target, the trigger mechanism keeping it from fully entering reality is destroyed. Due to a quirk of quantum mechanics' interactions with p-space, several copies of what are all technically the same projectile appear soon after it, dramatically multiplying the damage of what is still, from a scientific perspectice, a single shell.",,,

#Planets,,,,,
vic_cocytus,CUSTOM,"Arguably one of the most extensive and expensive private terraforming projects ever conducted prior to the Collapse. Turned from a lifeless rock into a sprawling garden to serve not only as the new corporate headquarters but also as the top management's ""vacation paradise"", Cocytus is the current home to the infamous Volkov Industrial Conglomerate, which gained full ownership of it and the rest of the system thanks to yet another shady deal with the Domain and the obligation of supporting colonization and development of the Sector.

Its endless summer and sandy beaches, thriving biosphere and warm oceans, picturesque golden sunsets and neversleeping island megapolises make it one of the most idyllic and desirable planets to live on in the entire Sector according to some, putting it on par with the dedicated ""Pleasure planets"" of the pre-Collapse times.",,,
vic_purgatory,CUSTOM,"Another terraforming project which, unlike Cocytus, went terribly wrong soon after the Collapse and the ""Jump Point Accident"" due to the lack of resources required for the process to continue. However, instead of completely abandoning the doomed world, VIC seized the opportunity and reorganised the infrastructure to fit into a new role.

These days unwelcoming Purgatory is where the Conglomerate's armies are made and trained, as well as where the most important research facilities are located, with the xenolife test material being brought in practically non-stop. The Conglomerate denies all false accusations of human experimenting and the equally false reports of pirate fleets coming to the planet after successful raids on the inhabited colonies.",,,
vic_phlegethon,CUSTOM,"""Are you looking for a high-paying job? Are you not afraid of breathtaking magma rivers and giant orbital lasers? Are you ready to face the Inferno and prove your worth? If the answer is ""Yes"", then We at VIC invite you to enlist in our famous Extraction Corps!

vic_archangel,CUSTOM,"The pride of VIC and a true technological marvel, ""Archangel"" mining station, positioned in the Lagrangian Point between Empyrean and Phlegethon, concentrates supergiant's light with the help of enormous Reflector Arrays™ and produces what could possibly be one the most devastating laser beams in the Sector. 

Scraping off useless exterior crust of Phlegeton, ""Archangel"" allows the miners to easily access exposed minerals and collect them by more conventional means. Thankfully, this is the only practical application the station is capable of, and the one it was initially built for. At least, according to the official statements of the Conglomerate. ",,,
vic_megaera,CUSTOM,"Once a regional Domain military base, nowadays this cold place serves as the junkyard, recycling facility and AM-fuel factory. Harsh climate, boring routine and impressive distance from the capital make Megaera a perfect place for the ""screw up"" subordinates to be sent to for prolonged business trips.

Before all the valuable equipment and personnel were relocated to other planets by the Conglomerate, this particular base was quite well-known among the Domain military higher-ups for its soldiers and special forces units, who demonstrated evidently inhuman physical and intellectual abilities during both the training and the service.

vic_fortuna,CUSTOM,,,,
vic_jump_point_stabilizer,CUSTOM,"An extremely complex device capable of stabilizing hyperspace Jump Points by exploiting convoluted quantum processes too inextricable for all but the most experienced physicists of the current era. It is with the help of these devices VIC's prolonged period of total isolation was ended. 

Potential results of using this technology on the stable working Jump Points are still being actively debated among the Sector's scientific community. ",,,
vic_kalada,CUSTOM,"A formerly independent colony which became the first victim of VIC after the corporation's sudden resurgence. Despite the initial rioting, the local populace is beginning to slowly accept the new regime that was brought in by the new supervisors. After all, with the steadily increasing quality of life, it becomes harder to deny that the Conglomerate does indeed care about the prosperity of its own people. Or, at least of those, who have enough to afford that prosperity.

However, not everyone accepts the current situation, with a vigilante resistance group ""Kaladian Swordsmen"" becoming increasingly prominent and popular among the opposition forces, much to the displeasure of VIC's newly appointed planetary managers. ",,,
vic_mithos,CUSTOM,"The not-so-important dusty colony of the Church of Galactic Redemption took on a second life after news of the VIC's return began to spread, especially soon after the occupation of Kalada.

Considered the main front of the war against evil, the planet is currently experiencing an economic and demographic boom, with the supporters of the Luddic Church from all over the Sector swarming to it in hopes that one day they'll get to break the hungry jaw of the Conglomerate and drive the monstrosity from the past back into the pits of hell. ",,,
vic_bernadian,CUSTOM,"Being the place of the first official meeting of VIC's and Hegemony's officials, this old outpost from the days of Hegemony's foundation received quite a lot of attention in the recent years. Despite all attempts of the local navy forces to prevent the fighting of the Luddic Church and the Conglomerate, the system still keeps filling with smoking debris. 

The rumours of VIC courier ships being sighted in the orbit more than 10 years ago haven't found any solid proof and the COMSEC marks said claims as prepostorous conspiracy.",,,
vic_maria,CUSTOM,"After several large-scale slave rebellions drowned in blood by the ruling self-imposed aristocracy made of former Urda Mining Co. management, heavily industrialized Maria stands on shaky ground, with both sides ready to gnaw at each other's throats. Despite the steadily rising tensions, the upper classes continue to reside and lead their hedonistic lifes in the luxurious arcologies on the wind-swept frozen surface, while the miners are struggling to survive yet another day in the dark polluted bowels of the planet. 

With VIC on the horizon, the fate of the ""proud and free"" colony is indeed difficult to predict.

vic_lemtis,CUSTOM,,,,
vic_ramus,CUSTOM,,,,
vic_pyktis,CUSTOM,,,,
vic_boerefuge,CUSTOM,,,,
vic_siaubas,CUSTOM,"A relatively small outback planet, mostly known for being the center of a massive rebellion of the days long gone. Unrest and armed riots led to the destruction of water treatment plants, which subsequently became one of the main causes of mass epidemic. Humanitarian aid and evacuation of the populace were quickly organized by the conjoined effort of the Domain and a local fleet of VIC, with the megacorp gladly volunteering to help fellow citizens in need. 

Once populous and promising colony, nowadays Siaubas is nothing more but a place of interest for archaeologists, historians and biologists of all kinds. Some of the latter occasionally report that the local fauna, which dwells the ruined, decaying cities, often shows unnerving, almost human-like patterns in behaviour and vocalizations. ",,,

#Commodities,,,,,
vic_genetech,RESOURCE,"That which made the Domain's higher-ups, military and the rich drool and turned VIC from a small backwater company into an enormous megacorporation. With the help of masterfully engineered DNA-modifying viruses, anything is possible - from simply changing the color of eyes and hair to lifespan extension, enhancement of physical and intellectual abilities, and even outright transforming one's anatomy and physiology with little to none limitations. Back in the days, the Conglomerate was looking forward to finally reveal these to the public and start selling them en masse; lobbying for the necessary laws wasn't that much of an issue - generous gifts to the powers that be were paying off in the end. 

All reports on negative side effects, including genemod addiction, heightened aggression, violent and animalistic tendencies, loss of identity and other mental deviations are surely nothing but pathetic anti-VIC propaganda.",,,
