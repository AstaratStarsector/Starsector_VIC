Volkov Industrial Conglomerate - New Mankind. New Future. New Paradise.""





Detailed information excerpted from an essay of a renowned Chicomoztoc's historian Joselyn Frye on VIC's origins, banned from further publishing by COMSEC with unusual haste:

""According to the surviving data, the history of VIC goes back at least as far as 400 years. Founded by business partners and longtime friends Victor Volkov and Marcus Tellen, the company was initially known as “Frontier Dynamics” and focused on supporting colonization effort of the Human Domain. An important turning point in the history of the growing business was the acquisition of Atagara MedTech, at that time actively engaged in genetic research and human life extension projects. A few months after the merger, Marcus Tellen suddenly left the company on what was reportedly an “ideological disagreement” with the CEO V. Volkov.

Renamed to VIC soon after Mr. Tellen's resignation and acquiring other companies with even greater fervor, the corporation soon started working even more closely with the Domain’s higher echelons, receiving hefty financial infusions and juridical privileges in return for merciless suppression of numerous rebellions, contracting with the military and providing personal services, details of which are either unknown up to this day, or too disturbing to describe in this particular essay. During that period, after accusing VIC of mass kidnappings and conduction of illegal human experiments in various fringe sectors, Marcus Tellen was soon found dead in his own house. According to the official statements, the cause of death was suicide, and the investigations against VIC were hastily terminated by the Domain’s officials the next month.

Taking into consideration all the available data about the VIC's controversial past, grim reputation, and their current stance, one can clearly see that, after its sudden resurgence in c+202, the Conglomerate presents a growing danger to the established powers of the Core Worlds. With their deranged obsession with non-limited genetic modifications; scheming politics, rampant bribing, possible ties to the current criminal underworld, and ruthless predatory actions against smaller factions and weak colonies (the most infamous example being Kalada), it has become crystal clear -  VIC is a threat that should be either put under total control or terminated completely as soon as it is possible.""",,,

#fighters,,,,,
vic_shabriri,SHIP,"VIC-F11 ""Shabriri"" is a blindingly-quick intercepter drone design. Fast, cheap, and numerous, Shabriris were designed as an attempt to compete with common Wasp drones, and to supplement VIC's general lack of point defense emplacements, even despite the Conglomerate's strict, Domain-like policy on automated war machines and artificial intelligences. ",,,
vic_asmoday,SHIP,"VIC-F25 ""Asmoday"" is a ""Shturmfighter"" - the designation VIC uses for what might be more commonly classified as a corvette. Armed with a Rarog Atomic Emitter, two autocannons, and even a pair of Laidlaw Mass Drivers, the Asmoday is truly a prince among strike craft, able to singlehandedly destroy wings of fighters or pressure full-sized warships. This turned out to be an unpleasant surprise for the Dassault-Micoyan Engineering forces during the second phase of the Cloud Wars, and upscaled the carnage to the point where the Domain officials finally stepped in to stop the unraveling conflict which already engulfed several planets and could prove to end up quite a disaster for the local populace.",,,
vic_sonneilon,SHIP,"VIC-F04 ""Sonneilon"" is VIC's distinct take on a bomber wing. Rather than using missiles, Sonneilons use a fusion charge to turn a metal projectile into many plasma shards and propel them at high speed at a target. The resulting impact is often enough to overwhelm shields and shred armor, making the Sonneilon a wing that inspires much hatred in those who have survived its barrage. It is somewhat fast for a bomber, but comes with no secondary armaments, so escort craft are recommended.",,,
vic_uvall,SHIP,"VIC-F33 ""Uvall"" is a heavily-armed and effective interceptor. Rumours persist that Uvall pilots have been genetically modified to experience limited precognition, such is their effectiveness in shutting down enemy ordnance and strike craft. Though of limited use against larger enemy ships, the Uvall is truly a premium alternative to Shabriris.",,,

#Ships,,,,,
#frigates,,,,,
vic_nybbas,SHIP,"VIC-X04 ""Nybbas"" - ""The Manager of Dreams,"" also dubbed ""The Weaver of Nightmares"" by both its pilots and those who face it in battle. Going beyond all reasonable, this unusual phase hyperfrigate at its core is nothing more but a giant chain of energy systems powering its weaponry, phase coils and teleportation drive. 

Created a couple of years prior to the Collapse as the ultimate ""hunter-assasin"" vessel, the Nybbas project is a great example of why the design bureau should never be given too much budget and freedom in decision-making.

Attempts to fit so much into the smallest possible hull led to the fact that Nybbas is almost completely devoid of any armor, storage, or even crew accomodation; the only logistics consideration was fuel capacity - less than any other Volkov ship. Huge amplitudes of energy surges during flight and active fighting make this ship absolutely unsuitable, dangerous, and sometimes even fatal for long-term piloting.

All crews unlucky enough to be assigned to Nybbas frigates are advised to take significant doses of painkillers and should immediately report any psychological or physiological abnormalities after prolonged combat operations.",,,
vic_pruflas,SHIP,"VIC-S75 ""Pruflas"" - ""Discord Provoker,"" a reconaissance frigate of novel design with paper-thin armour but unmatched mobility and decent firepower. 

Not entering the service until after the Collapse, Pruflas frigates are the fastest vessels at the megacorp's disposal. Their spectacular speed and impressive fuel-to-distance consumption ratio secured their role not only of the main scouting units, but also of the VICES Department's (VIC Exclusive Solutions) courier ships, capable of quickly delivering valuable information and the so-called ""special gifts"" to the Hegemony's officials, pirate warlords and higher-ups of many other both major and minor powers of the Sector. In many cases such generous signs of goodwill still do not ensure proper cooperation between the addressees and the Conglomerate, but usually it's just enough to forge more stable relations with the higher echelons and to prevent full-fledged military confrontation, even if hatred and disgust towards the megacorp remain in their fullest among the general population. ",,,
vic_kobal,SHIP,"VIC-B19 ""Kobal"" - ""Killing Joke"" was an early testbed for VIC's Adaptive Assault Configuration system, later seen in the Samael and Thamuz classes. Noticing that standard Accelerated Ammo Feeder and High Energy Focus systems were ill-suited to the hybrid mounts dominating Volkov design doctrine. The Adaptive Assault Configuration is essentially both systems fused together with a single power source between them, to which energy is automatically allocated based on the ship's equipped weapons. Efficiency is lost, however, when weapons are split between ballistic and energy types.

Classified as a heavy frigate, the Kobal-class is powerfully armed, and has the structural integrity to fire its weapons without shaking itself apart while its system is active. It lacks, however, any point defense weaponry, making it vulnerable to attack craft and flanking enemies. This particular oversight became extremely obvious in the first half of the Cloud Wars between VIC and the Dassault-Micoyan Engineering, with hundreds of the Conglomerate's pilots falling victim to the nimble white-blue fighters. ",,,
vic_xaphan,SHIP,"VIC-A01 ""Xaphan"" - ""Diabolical Stoker,"" an aggressive ship with a long history that has undergone several significant alterations throughout its service to the Conglomerate. Embodying the entire essence of the military doctrine of the megacorporation (fragile aerodynamic body, powerful shield and flux dissipation systems, high maneuverability and concentrated frontal firepower), Xaphan is currently one of the most mass-produced vessels of the VIC and often takes the spotlight in numerous air parades.

Like the Kobal-class before it, Xaphans are lacking in point defense. The increased stress from ""Hellfire"" weapons system doubles their logistical cost to install, thus it only has the space to fit smaller weapons. While this may seem a detriment, many of the weapons it can mount may double as point defense solutions, and its drastically increased agility makes outflanking a much less meaningful threat. When its engines do not provide enough of a kick on their own, pilots can use the onboard Omni-Lunge to dodge heavy incoming fire or to chase down an enemy.",,,
#destroyers,,,,,
vic_jezebeth,SHIP,"VIC-C96 ""Jezebeth"" - ""The Queen of Lies"" has a deceptively destructive arsenal at its disposal. Inspired by the late-Domain Sunder, Jezebeths were an attempt to play even further into their strengths. Slightly faster, but noticeably less agile and frailer, the Jezebeth-class is the definition of a glass cannon and is one of the favourites among the Aerospace Corps' middle officer ranks, many of which prefer to stay behind the frontlines and let their subordinates do the heavy lifting instead. 

The Jezebeth project almost hit a dead end when VIC aerospace engineers realized that, unlike the earlier Samael-class, Jezebeths wouldn't have the structural integrity to handle the Adaptive Assault system, especially with its upsized armaments. Fortuitously, clandestine Volkov efforts were able to ""recover"" an intact Afflictor-class phase frigate around this time. While the phase cloak technology itself would go into the Nybbas project, the modified phase coil array proved to be possible to mount to the Jezebeth prototype hull--much too small to bring the destroyer into p-space, however. The Entropy Amplifier serves much the same role as a damage-increasing system, but causes much less strain on the hull. Removing the Adaptive Assault system allowed them to upscale the integrated drone bay to a full-sized modular wing bay, dramatically increasing its potential versatility. The resulting hull is among the most dangerous in the sector for its deployment cost.",,,
vic_samael,SHIP,"VIC-B49 “Samael” - “Angel of Death” is a heavier model of a destroyer created out of necessity after admirals noticed the Moloch’s lack of staying power while holding a battleline. The Samael, in comparison to its much more agile peer, boasts improved armor plating, wider shield angles, superior point defense suite and wider turret firing angles to allow for better engagement of multiple threats. 

Further playing into this, VIC engineers replaced the Moloch's Omni-Lunge--much more suited to aggressors and flankers--with the newer Adaptive Assault Configuration, adapted from the Kobal. While its forbear hull had a notable weakness to enemy strike craft, the Samael-class is capable of mounting a full array of point defense weaponry. Perhaps overcompensating for the Kobal's downside, Samaels even have an integrated wing of Shabriri Interceptor Drones, making it a truly difficult target for enemy munitions and wings.

Despite Samael's relatively simple design, the engineers involved in its creation kept claiming that the process was, quote, ""as messy as Mr. Volkov's favourite hairstyle"", and involved failing deadlines, a significant amount of crunches and possibly even some abuse of psycho-stimulating substances in dire moments of designing crisis. ",,,
vic_moloch,SHIP,"VIC-A33 ""Moloch"" - ""Bull King,"" a strikingly aggressive destroyer, set the standard for all Volkov Industrial Conglomerate hulls to come, mainly the now-mandatory atmo-travel solutions. The first 100% in-house design manufactured by the newly acquired Karzenlicht Luft-Raum Inc., the Moloch-class also introduced the Omni-Lunge system. While it was designed to fly in atmosphere, the aerospace division worried that, if it were forced to land, lift surfaces alone would be insufficient for it to take off, especially with the unlikelyhood of ground terrain being suitable for takeoff. They thus reinforced the maneuvering jets and introduced additional fuel for an afterburner-like effect, similar to plasma jets but with an omnidirectional effect, making the craft VTOL-capable.

Combat crews quickly realized the utility of the Omni-Lunge system in the battlespace, drastically increasing the ship's evasive and pursuit abilities, and their respectable weapons complement make them a credible threat. Molochs are nimble and aggressive; though they lack any rear-facing point defense, few ships are able to outmaneuver them to capitalize on this.

In addition, it was with the Moloch that the long history of the (in)famous Aerospace Corps began. While the Conglomerate's pilots serve as one of the main tools of corporate propaganda and are righteous heroes in the eyes of the public, other departments treat them with thinly-veiled irritation, if not outright contempt. ""Head in the clouds"" - this saying is too well suited to the Aerospace Corps, as their fame-induced pride, arrogant self-centred bravado, and cocky attitudes often get the better of them.",,,
#cruisers,,,,,
vic_cresil,SHIP,"VIC-C67 ""Cresil"" - ""The Creeping Corruption,"" one of the oldest Volkov hulls still in service, is dependable enough to remain VIC's primary carrier. Predating the ""aerodynamic design"" doctrine, the Cresil-class, through the installation of viral containment systems, is perhaps much more dangerous to a planet than any atmosphere-capable warship ever could be. The leading project engineer of the time, Miro Honda, regarded Cresil as ""a big step in planetary suppresion methods"", while the secure refrigeration vaults necessary to carry their deadly cargo have given these ships a nickname some employees have complained is problematic and highly inappropriate - ""Ice Cream Trucks"".

Though rumors of viral bombardment ships have led to some enemies of the Conglomerate to conclude that Cresils are logistics ships, nothing could be further than the truth. Despite their weak hulls and subpar flux reactor, Cresils project death just as well as any mainline warship through their extensive modular flight decks. In terms of carrier capacity, the Cresil-class matches the venerable Legion. Fearing their relative fragility, however, Cresils have the ability to recall their wings to defend their mothership, meaning a Cresil is never truly alone.",,,
vic_thamuz,SHIP,"VIC-B62 ""Thamuz"" - ""Ambassador of Heavy Arms,"" created shortly after the Samael's completion, was VIC aerospace's attempt to supplant the ubiquitous Dominator-class heavy cruiser. Though the Domain admiralty was unimpressed at the time, preferring swifter and more versatile cruisers, the Thamuz-class would quickly prove its worth within Volkov fleets as an implacable dealer of death, the mere rumour of which is enough to make would-be raiders think twice. Though it can't output quite as many missiles as a Dominator and its hull is admittedly weaker, its modern flux reactor, powerful shields, and triple complement of large hybrid weapon mounts make it a force to be feared and reckoned with.

As one of the slowest of all VIC ships, Thamuz, created in an attempt to radically reimagine the established doctrine, has a rather controversial reputation. Scorned by many Conglomerate captains for its awkwardness and clumsiness, heavily armoured Thamuz is nevertheless best at performing where brute force is needed. A powerful Karzenlicht Luft-Raum Inc. fifth-generation reactor, an arsenal capable of competing even with the firepower of far bigger battleships, as well as enhanced protection of the crew quarters make this heavy cruiser a surprisingly comfortable vessel, a flight of which significantly strengthens the formation of modern Conglomerate fleets.",,,
vic_valafar,SHIP,"VIC-A58 ""Valafar"" - ""The Hunting Lion,"" designed to fill the fast assault role so popular among Volkov admirals, is a simple and brutal warship. Its large spiral hardpoint gives it crushing jaws, and its Omni-Lunge system gives it a deadly pounce. With a supplementary missiles and a solid point defense grid, the Valafar has no real weaknesses to be exploited. As a so-called Shturmcruiser, it is expected to face near the heaviest engagements of any Volkov vessel. As fast as an Aurora, it is easily capable of hunting down destroyers and ripping them to shreds.

Despite its chubby appearance, caused by the need to install a powerful propulsion system (a decision lobbied by the younger, far more vigorous generation of officers), Valafar has won the love of the Conglomerate's crews from the very start of production for its agility in space and amazing smoothness in piloting even in a thick atmosphere. A special kind of entertainment for the pilots was (and still is) flying over enemy positions without using weapons, since the sound wave from the cruiser rushing right above the surface is enough to leave a furrow a couple of dozen meters deep, not to mention the damage to the surrounding infrastructure and the deadly effect on living organisms in the vicinity. Such provocative displays of meaningless brutality are criticized by the higher ranking officers, but in most cases no repercusions are followed.",,,
#capitals,,,,,
vic_apollyon,SHIP,"VIC-A71 ""Apollyon"" - ""The Destroyer,"" a shining symbol of VIC's aerospace engineering, an unusually mobile capital ship for its significant size, equipped with just enough weaponry to obliterate entire enemy fleets on its own. However, due to the design being focused on raw offense and speed, the Apollyon lacks capital-grade armour and is incapable of withstanding focused enemy attacks, even with the help of a powerful shield generator.

Conceived out of spite towards Tri-Tachyon and with the goal of overthrowing the Paragon's reign in the Domain's Navy, the Apollyon project ended up being one of the most ambitious and expensive endeavours in Conglomerate history, with the developement costs nearing the price of a couple of outback planets combined. Unsurprisingly, most of the time and budget were spent on calculating how to apply jet-fighter principles to the hull of such size.

Unfortunately for VIC, and despite all their efforts, the project still didn't manage to make its way into the Navy. The main reason for that - the Collapse happening right in the middle of Apollyon's first official presentation, mere seconds after the prototype turned a Paragon test target into a melted metallic mess to the thunderous applause of the Admiralty's officials. 

To the great delight of the surviving Central Design Bureau, the project wasn't scrapped after the Collapse and eventually entered mass production to serve both as VIC's most potent assault vessel and as one of its main propaganda tools. Nowadays the imposing Apollyon-class shturmcapitals proudly roam the Sector at the head of the Conglomerate's fleets, both playing the role of a compelling argument during numerous diplomatic negotiations and truly living up to their old biblical name in battles.

#Weapons,,,,,
vic_heavylaidlawaccelerator,WEAPON,"A long-range and expensive weapon that deals heavy damage near-instantaneously, if somewhat inaccurately. Despite the addition of ""heavy"" to its name, the Heavy Laidlaw Accelerator was actually the first such weapon developed, when the Conglomerate faced the need for a powerful jack-of-all-trades of a weapon for their ships.

Iconic Laidlaw weapons use the so-called ""Laidlaw Effect,"" a Volkov trade secret, to accelerate projectiles to a greater degree than other forms of linear motors, such as coil or railguns. The process has a side-effect of turning a solid metallic projectile into a stream of superheated plasma. Hypervelocity impacts can evaporate large chunks of hull, the explosive burst of which causes additional destruction. Created by ""The Father of VIC tech"", Ernesto Laidlaw, these weapons are used ubiquitously by the Conglomerate, with their sizes ranging from handheld rifles to enormous planetary siege cannons.",,,
vic_capacitonsDischarger,WEAPON,"A short-range arcing tesla cannon, overpowering shields and disabling ships with EMP damage. The Capacitons Discharger is a flux-expensive weapon to fire, but is devastating to shields and arcs to surrounding targets--including missiles and fighters, though it lacks the ability to automatically target the former.

One of the less conventional weapons of VIC, Capacitons Discharger uses the principle of cascade looping of flux reactors. By connecting the energy profiles of the firing ship and its targets with  active shields, the discharger causes monstrous disturbances in the energy systems of both sides, which is almost always guaranteed to quickly end in a blinding overload of one of them. Such an unusual mechanism of action greatly limits the list of platforms on which the Dischargers can be installed and even VIC commanders aren't keen on using this wild beast of a weapon due to its nuances and intricacies.  ",,,
vic_devastator,WEAPON,"A Volkov weapon inspired by the Devastator Cannon, but with a more offensive focus, the Besomar Scattercannon is a large ammo-fed explosive shotgun. Capable of impressive burst damage, the Besomar strips armor and wrecks smaller ships.",,,
vic_psotnik,WEAPON,"A medium-range shield suppression autocannon that delivers an impressive amount of 50mm EMP payload. Though its individual shots deal little damage, the Psotnik Interference Autocannon fires a hailstorm of them. Despite being kinetic projectiles, the EMP arcing prevents enemy ships from safely absorbing them by turning off their shields.

Surprisingly, the original version of the weapon did not include the use of EMP shells. A significant upgrade, including the installation of an internal magnetic reactor and protective insulation for the targeting systems, took place after the battle in orbit of Nikorus 6, in which the heavily armored rebel ships proved surprisingly effective even against a storm of autocannon shells from the Conglomerate's ships.",,,
,,,,,
vic_rubicon,WEAPON,"A medium-range kinetic weapon which multiplies its projectiles to overwhelm shields. The Rubicon's projectile exists in a state of quantum uncertainty, occupying many possible locations at any given time. When the projectile impacts against a target, the trigger mechanism keeping it from fully entering reality is destroyed. Due to a quirk of quantum mechanics' interactions with p-space, several copies of what are all technically the same projectile appear soon after it, dramatically multiplying the damage of what is still, from a scientific perspectice, a single shell.",,,
vic_verlioka,WEAPON,"A potent defensive energy weapon based on the same principle employed by the Hyperspace Coherence Adjustment Units. Prolonged powerful waves of disruptive quantum fluctuations are capable of literally ripping smaller entities apart, turning their atomic structure into a chaotic quark mess. The effect on bigger targets if far less prominent, which makes Verlioka relatively useless against anything bigger than a Hound. 

The Conglomerate's crews and ship maintenance personnel are regularly instructed on safety protocols regarding Verliokas, as even a single miscalculation or malfunction in the weapon's systems can result in a rather unpleasant red-tinted scene in a radius of several hundred meters. ",,,
vic_lightlaidlawaccelerator,WEAPON,"A medium-range and expensive weapon that deals heavy damage near-instantaneously, if somewhat inaccurately. The Laidlaw Accelerator is essentially a single barrel of the heavy version, delivering crushing blows at unprecedented speeds.

vic_gagana,WEAPON,"A medium-range ballistic weapons which fires high explosive smart shells, which have a limited degree of tracking. The Gagana Dart Launcher reliably strips armor and damages hull, and the darts contain a delayed explosive charge, triggered after the projectile burrow into hull.

Though its darts do not have the independent propulsion necessary to classify them as missile weapons, their course corrective quality nonetheless makes them more accurate than standard cannons, and surprisingly effective against fighters.",,,
,,,,,
vic_strigoy,WEAPON,"A defensive weapon that fires a cluster of proximity-fused fragmentation shells. Effective against missiles and strike craft.

Smaller iterations of this fragmentation cannon are often mounted onto the Conglomerate's heavy exosuit troopers, with little to none competition when it comes to getting rid of the enemy infantry and lightly armoured vehicles. ",,,
vic_rarog,WEAPON,"An accurate close-range fusion beam which rends through unshielded fighters and lighter armor, the Rarog Atomic Emitter is somewhat unusual for an energy weapon. It is devastatingly effective against unshielded targets. Its good damage and tracking make it an effective PD weapon if an Integrated Point Defense AI is installed.",,,
vic_laidlawMassDriver,WEAPON,"A medium-range and expensive weapon that deals heavy damage near-instantaneously, if somewhat inaccurately. The Laidlaw Mass Driver is the result of efforts to miniaturize Laidlaw technology, and is somewhat less potent than larger versions.

#Planets,,,,,
vic_cocytus,CUSTOM,"Arguably one of the most extensive and expensive private terraforming projects ever conducted prior to the Collapse. Turned from a lifeless rock into a sprawling garden to serve not only as the new corporate headquarters but also as the top management's ""vacation paradise"", Cocytus is the current home to the infamous Volkov Industrial Conglomerate, which gained full ownership of it and the rest of the system thanks to yet another shady deal with the Domain and the obligation of supporting colonization and development of the Persean Sector.

Its endless summer and sandy beaches, thriving biosphere and warm oceans, picturesque golden sunsets and never-sleeping island megapolises make it one of the most idyllic and desirable planets to live on in the entire Sector according to some, putting it on par with the dedicated ""Pleasure planets"" of the pre-Collapse times.",,,
vic_purgatory,CUSTOM,"Another terraforming project which, unlike Cocytus, went terribly wrong soon after the Collapse and the ""Jump Point Accident,"" due to the lack of resources required for the process to continue. However, instead of completely abandoning the doomed world, VIC seized the opportunity and reorganised the infrastructure to fit into a new role.

These days the inhospitable Purgatory is where the Conglomerate's armies are made and trained, as well as where the most important research facilities are located, with xenolife testing material being brought in practically non-stop. The Conglomerate denies all false accusations of human experimentation and the equally false reports of pirate fleets coming to the planet after successful raids on inhabited colonies.",,,
vic_phlegethon,CUSTOM,"Ever since Explorarium probes sent back their first data about the Empyrean system, Phlegethon has attracted a lot of attention due to its impressive mineral deposits. However, it was only with the arrival of VIC and the launch of ""Archangel"" that it became possible to quickly break through the hard crust and extract resources within the superheated planet.

Scraping off Phlegeton's useless exterior crust, ""Archangel"" allows the miners to easily access exposed minerals and collect them by more conventional means.

vic_megaera,CUSTOM,"Once a regional Domain military base, nowadays this cold place serves as a junkyard, recycling facility, and AM-fuel factory.

Potential results of using this technology on the stable working Jump Points are still being actively debated among the Sector's scientific community. ",,,
vic_kalada,CUSTOM,"A formerly independent colony which became the first victim of VIC after the corporation's sudden resurgence. Despite the initial rioting, the local populace is beginning to slowly accept the regime that was brought in by the new supervisors. After all, with the steadily increasing quality of life, it becomes harder to deny that the Conglomerate does indeed care about the prosperity of its own people. Or, at least, those who have enough to afford that prosperity.

However, not everyone accepts the current situation, with a vigilante resistance group, the ""Kaladian Swordsmen,"" becoming increasingly prominent and popular among the opposition forces, much to the displeasure of VIC's newly-appointed planetary managers. ",,,
vic_mithos,CUSTOM,"This not-so-important dusty colony of the Church of Galactic Redemption took on a second life after the news of VIC's return began to spread, especially soon after the occupation of Kalada.

With VIC on the horizon, the fate of the ""proud and free"" colony is indeed difficult to predict.

vic_lemtis,CUSTOM,"An extremely curious--if not unique--case of a planet being caught in-between the stars of two merging systems. Unfortunately, this astronomical miracle is quite short-lived; according to the scientists, Lemtis will either fall into one of the stars, or will be torn apart by their gravitational fields in the next few decades.

Only madmen would attempt to establish a long-lasting infrastructure on this doomed planet. Or the followers of the Luddic Path, who now terrorize the local region, hiding behind the scorching heat and amidst the electromagnetic storms.",,,
vic_ramus,CUSTOM,"Not wanting to be under the total control of the hegemony or the religious fanaticism of the Church of Galactic Redemption, the ruling circles of the former regional logistics center tried to hide under the protection of the Persean League. To some extent, they did, even though they are now a much more significant target for the Hegemony and the Church, both of which, until that moment, had no interest in the dusty colony whatsoever.",,,
vic_pyktis,CUSTOM,"After the end of the Second AI war, the Tri-Tachyon Corporation was faced with a serious need to re-establish its sphere of influence. Incredibly poor and ready to accept any new authority in exchange for medicine, food, and supplies, this desert colony offered no resistance at all. Tri-Tachyon, as a token of gratitude, genuinely fullfilled a small part of their promises.",,,
vic_boerefuge,CUSTOM,"Who is Boe? No one really knows. Perhaps they were a rich director of a former mining station in the asteroid belt. Or maybe an ordinary miner who became famous for their hard work and cheerful spirit. Or maybe a criminal who escaped from the prison of the Hegemony, found shelter on an abandoned piece of scrap metal and turned it into a favorite place for pirates from all over the area.

It doesn't matter who Boe is. The only thing that does matter, is that the local trade convoys are not happy at all. And that the beer at the bar is some of the best in the whole system.",,,
vic_siaubas,CUSTOM,"A relatively small outback planet, mostly known for being the center of a massive rebellion in days long gone. Unrest and armed riots led to the destruction of water treatment plants, which subsequently became one of the main causes of mass epidemic. Humanitarian aid and evacuation of the populace were quickly organized by the conjoined effort of the Domain and a local Volkov fleet, with the megacorp gladly volunteering to help fellow citizens in need. 

Once a populous and promising colony, nowadays Siaubas is nothing more but a place of interest for archaeologists, historians, and biologists of all kinds. Some of the latter occasionally report that the local fauna, which dwells among the ruined, decaying cities, often shows unnerving, almost human-like patterns in behaviour and vocalizations. ",,,

vic_genetech,RESOURCE,"That which made the Domain's higher-ups, military, and the rich drool, and turned VIC from a small backwater company into an enormous megacorporation. With the help of masterfully engineered DNA-modifying viruses, anything is possible--from simply changing eye/hair colour to lifespan extension, enhancement of physical and intellectual abilities, and even outright transforming one's anatomy and physiology with little to no limitations. Back in the days, the Conglomerate was looking forward to finally reveal these to the public and start selling them en masse; lobbying for the necessary laws wasn't that much of an issue--generous gifts to the powers that be were paying off in the end. 

All reports on negative side effects, including genemod addiction, heightened aggression, violent and animalistic tendencies, loss of identity, and other mental deviations are surely nothing but pathetic anti-VIC propaganda.",,,
